In this letter from a city in Anatolia, located on the northern edge of the Fertile Crescent in what is now southern Turkey, a Mesopotamian merchant complains to his brother at home, hundreds of miles away, that life is hard and comments on the trade in silver, gold, tin, and textiles. Correspondents often enclosed letters in clay envelopes and sealed them by rolling a cylinder seal across the clay, leaving the impression of a scene, just as you might use a stamped wax seal today.",

The children, several holding birds or bird toys, have partly shaved heads and what scholars of Egypt term the “sidelock of youth,” a long braided lock of hair common in Egyptian paintings of children that indicates the child was an heir of the god Osiris. Inherkau oversaw artisans and workers on the royal tombs at Thebes, as had his father and grandfather before him, for which they all carried the splendid title “Foreman of the Lord of the Two Lands in the Place of Truth.”",

States first developed in the southern part of Mesopotamia known as Sumer, where priests and rulers invented ways to control and organize people who lived in cities reliant on irrigation. Conquerors from the north unified Mesopotamian city-states into larger empires and spread Mesopotamian culture over a large area.",
